  This is the experiment that should provide vital information to refine the theory and the simulation
  
  1. positron scanning microscope
  1.2 anti-photon scanning microscope
  2. the idea here is that the electron and two positrons will collide with each other to produce 
     anti-photons , and hopefully this will shed some light on darkmatter,
     the interesting part about this is the effect that a anti-photon would have on the 
     control over the particle, the momentum accuracy or the position accuracy.
     
     would anti-photons change the geometry of the electron to look like the 6D electron ?
     
     or would you see both the 4D and the 6D electron ???
     
     how else might that effect the electron ???
     
     would the anti-photon give us more control over the particle to be able to 
     move it into position better ???
