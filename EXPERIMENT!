  This is the experiment that should provide vital information to refine the theory and the simulation !!!
  
 
  1. Anti-Photon Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
  2. The idea here is that the electron and two positrons will collide with each other to produce 
     anti-photons , and hopefully this will shed some light on darkmatter,( = Anti-Matter in the 6Dimension ?)
     within the electron.
     
     The interesting part about this is the effect that a anti-photon would have on the 
     control over the particle, the momentum accuracy or the position accuracy.
     
     Would anti-photons change the geometry of the electron to look like the 6D electron ?
     
     Or would you see both the 4D and the 6D electron ???
     
     How else might that effect the electron ???
     
     Would Cells and other Microscopic Organisms look different under the Anti-Photon Scanning Microscope ?
     
     Would the anti-photon give us more control over the particle to be able to 
     move it into position better during nuclear capture ???
