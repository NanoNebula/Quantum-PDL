  This is the experiment that should provide vital information to refine the theory and the simulation
  
  1. electron + positron scanning microscope 
  2. the idea here is that the electron and positron will collide with each other to produce 
     photons and anti-photons , and hopefully this will shed some light on darkmatter,
     which would be considered 6D matter ...
