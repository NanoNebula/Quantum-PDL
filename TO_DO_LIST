### 1.0 asm_inline hack -> recycle the RAM so that the electron does not crash the computer when we run out of memory !!!
### might be a perl_RAM_Recycle_module_for_PDL

###  1.1 next to do get the lowest energy level, or the first electron absorbtion frequency wavelength energy.
##      and calibrate the electron to be made of those photons instead of the 2444, which at this time just seems to work.
##      in other words get the right amount of photons to match the right values, think about scaling properly 
##      so that RAM is conserved !

    

### 2. Get all energy levels based on the "quantum numbers", and the orbit energy levels of all atoms.
###    so that the mass length time current for the electron are all the right values !

##  3. get colors right for the different levels of the differnt atoms  "research spectropolarimetry more"

## 4. make youtube video of two electrons entangled
##    get the right song to go with the simulation ;}
##    to show the theory of 6dimensional with in 4D entanglement with out using the a 6Dimensional Framework ,"yet!"
##    or a 4Dimensional framework

## 5. get upquark and down quark [mass][length][time][current] done right with the right amount of photons
##    that make each along with the right values for the photons the frequency wavelength and energy

## 6. use the contrast from the electron and the quarks to deduce the 4D and 6D frameworks.
##    so that photon concentrations of the right frequency wavelenght and energy naturally 
##    create the electron and the up and down quarks 

## 7. get the youtube video of the 4Dimensional spacetime framework done 
##    as follows: there are 4 sides of a tetrahedron each side is a array of slices
##    that when put together make the 4D framework

## 8. get youtube video of 6Dimensional framework done 
##    as follows there are 6 sides to a double tetrahedron each side is a array of slices
##    that when put together make the 6D framework

## 9. put the tetrahedron dynamic vector geometry inside the 4D framework deduce the  transcendental equations
##    to simpify the mathematics and the matrices scaling and integration with the particles it makes from photons
##    and how they control the interactions with other particles 
##
## 10. do the same with the 6Dimensional framework 

## 11. integrate the 4D framework into the [x y z] part of the PDL coordinate system  
## 12. integrate the 6D framework into the [r g b] part of the PDL coordinate system 

## 13. teleport the right amount of photons at the right energy frequency wavelength 
##     into the 4D and 6D frameworks to and confirm that the electron or and the quarks were created
##     based on the 4D and 6D engine...
