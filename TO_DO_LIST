### 1.0 asm_inline hack -> recycle the RAM so that the electron does not crash the computer when we run out of memory !!!
### might be a perl_RAM_Recycle_module_for_PDL

###  1.1 Next to do get the lowest energy level, or the first electron absorbtion frequency wavelength energy.
##      and calibrate the electron to be made of those photons instead of the 2444, which at this time just seems to work.
##      in other words get the right amount of photons to match the right values, think about scaling properly 
##      so that RAM is conserved !

    

### 2. Get all energy levels based on the "quantum numbers", and the orbit energy levels of all atoms.
###    so that the mass length time current for the electron are all the right values !

##  3. Get colors right for the different levels of the differnt atoms  "research spectropolarimetry more"

## 4. Make youtube video of two electrons entangled
##    get the right song to go with the simulation ;}
##    to show the theory of 6dimensional with in 4D entanglement with out using the a 6Dimensional Framework ,"yet!"
##    or a 4Dimensional framework

## 5. Get upquark and down quark [mass][length][time][current] done right with the right amount of photons
##    that make each along with the right values for the photons the frequency wavelength and energy

## 6. Use the contrast from the electron and the quarks to deduce the 4D and 6D frameworks.
##    so that photon concentrations of the right frequency wavelength and energy naturally 
##    create the electron and the up and down quarks 

## 7. Get the youtube video of the 4Dimensional spacetime framework done 
##    as follows: there are 4 sides of a tetrahedron each side is a array of slices
##    that when put together they make the 4D framework 

## 8. Get youtube video of 6Dimensional framework done 
##    as follows there are 6 sides to a double tetrahedron each side is a array of slices
##    that when put together make the 6D framework

## 9. Put the tetrahedron dynamic vector geometry inside the 4D framework deduce the  transcendental equations
##    to simpify the mathematics and the matrices scaling and integration with the particles it makes from photons
##    and how they control the interactions with other particles 
##
## 10. Do the same with the 6Dimensional framework 

## 11. Integrate the 4D framework into the [x y z] part of the PDL coordinate system  
## 12. Integrate the 6D framework into the [r g b] part of the PDL coordinate system 

## 13. Teleport the right amount of photons at the right energy frequency wavelength 
##     into the 4D and 6D frameworks to confirm that the electron and or the quarks were created
##     based on the 4D and 6D engine with the right photon energy frequency wavelength, and the particles
##     have the right [mass] [length] [time] [current]...

## 14. Confirm all atoms by teleporting quarks (photons, strings) and that they were created properly
##     based on the right number of photons at the right energy level the right frequency wavelength
##     and the ions all have the right [mass] [length] [time] [current]

## 15. Create software to match spectrograph data to create "virtuial Quantum microscope" 

## 16. Get the electronics for the spectrograph complete to integrate into the computer threw 
##     ethernet and usbs. 

## 17. Confirm the "virtual Quantum microscope" -> NanoNebula is working properly 

## 18. Add in API application to create molecules from atoms, from easy to use application 

## 19. Create HyperSonic Assembler Solvers to calculate the right differential equations 
##     to put the atoms together to make the molecules. 

## 20. Make framework so that users can make molecules in the simulator, and Send them in to 
##    the Nano-Factorys to be assembled as usefull products nano-electronics etc

## 21. Create training certifications to get people to work in team's.

## 22. Create electronics to increase computation speed and productivity.

## 23.  Get billions of people to work on the "[Error Checking Gene]"

## 24.  Make laws for which genes should not be removed or added

## 25. Work on extra-dimensional quantum telemetry, to teleport genes to and from patients
##     to cure all genetic diseases 

## 26. Reengineer the MRI Modules to do this:; When Patients ask whats wrong with them ..
       Tell them nothing go home, make them feel as if they were just imagining there symptoms ...
