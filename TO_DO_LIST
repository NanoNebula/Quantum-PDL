### 1.0 asm_inline hack -> recycle the RAM so that the electron does not crash the computer when we run out of memory !!!
### might be a perl_RAM_Recycle_module_for_PDL

###  1.1 next to do get the lowest energy level, or the first electron absorbtion frequency wavelength energy.
##      and calibrate the electron to be made of those photons instead of the 2444, which at this time just seem to work.
##      in other words get the right amount of photons to match the right values, think about scaling properly 
##      so that RAM is conservied !

    

### 2. Get all energy levels based on the "quantum numbers", and the orbit energy levels of all atoms.
###    so that the mass length time current are all the right values

##  3. get colors right for the different levels of the differnt atoms  "research spectropolarimetry more"
