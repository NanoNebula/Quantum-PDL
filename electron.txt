What we want to achive here is a discussion about the electron and how to get the 
dimensions of [Mass] [Length] [Time] [Current] from the "Photon Positions" that 
make up the electron, with these "Matrix" values we can determine any dimension. 

There is a certain amount of points needed to do this, I would say at least 10,000 
photon point positions in a matrix, with the more point positions the better the 
Accuracy.

One of the main formula's for the [Length] of the x,y,z matrix particle is 
 $Length = sqrt($x**2+$y**2+$z**2);  
 
 The Length of $x,$y is -> sqrt($x**2+$y**2).
 The Length of $y,$z is -> sqrt($y**2+$z**2).
 The Length of $x,$z is -> sqrt($x**2+$z**2).
 
 With that view we get a more defined Matrix value of the ([Volume] = [Length]**3) of the particle 
 [Density] = [Mass]/[Volume], the [Area] = [Length]**2.
 
 One thing I have been struggling here is with getting the [Mass] matrix of the particle 
 from the photon positions, as I have not yet found a definite formula for how to do this.
 
 I have deduced that I might be able to do this from a ratio of the [Length] matrix,
 and then Summing all the photon [Masses] Matrix, and compareing there porportions. which should 
 match experimental results, if indeed the electron is sphereical. new tests seem to confirm this..
 
 If we take a look at the electron.pl code we see the electron geometry and the Hbar geometry.
